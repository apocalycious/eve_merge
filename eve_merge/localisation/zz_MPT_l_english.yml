 pc_greenhouse_hot:0 "Hot Greenhouse World"
 pc_greenhouse_hot_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a thick, high pressure atmosphere. The gases in the atmosphere have caused a runaway greenhouse effect, creating very high surface temperatures."
 pc_greenhouse_hot_habitability:0 "Hot Greenhouse Habitability"
 pc_greenhouse_hot_tile:0 "Hot Greenhouse Terrain"
 pc_greenhouse_hot_tile_desc:0 "Dry, hostile and very hot desertscape interspersed with slab-like rocks."
 pc_semi_barren:0 "Semi-Barren World"
 pc_semi_barren_desc:0 "Barren and rocky world with a thin atmosphere and polar ice caps. The surface is covered in meteor impact craters and seemingly devoid of life."
 pc_semi_barren_habitability:0 "Barren Habitability"
 pc_semi_barren_tile:0 "Barren Terrain"
 pc_semi_barren_tile_desc:0 "Barren and dry terrain with occasional rocky outcroppings."
 pc_greenhouse_cold:0 "Cold Greenhouse World"
 pc_greenhouse_cold_desc:0 "A rocky planet with a dense atmosphere. Despite being far from the parent star, the gases in the atmosphere have caused a greenhouse effect, allowing exotic liquids such as methane and ethane to exist on the surface."
 pc_greenhouse_cold_habitability:0 "Cold Greenhouse Habitability"
 pc_greenhouse_cold_tile:0 "Cold Greenhouse Terrain"
 pc_greenhouse_cold_tile_desc:0 "Very cold hostile terrain, with dunes, rivers, lakes and seas of strange liquids."
 pc_frozen_large:0 "Frozen World"
 pc_frozen_large_desc:0 "Large rocky world covered in a thick layer of permanently frozen ice. Low temperatures and a very thin atmosphere precludes the existence of life on the surface."
 pc_frozen_large_habitability:0 "Frozen Habitability"
 pc_frozen:0 "Small Frozen World"
 pc_frozen_large_tile:0 "Frozen Terrain"
 pc_frozen_large_tile_desc:0 "Barren and ice-covered terrain."
 tech_advanced_terraforming:0 "Advanced Terraforming"
 tech_advanced_terraforming_desc:1 "New techniques in manipulating the temperature and atmosphere of planets allows us to make previously lifeless bodies habitable.\n\n"
 pc_gas_giant:0 "Gas Giant"
 pc_gas_giant_desc:0 "Gaseous planet with an atmosphere primarily composed of hydrogen and helium surrounding a dense core."
 pc_gas_giant_hot:0 "Hot Gas Giant"
 pc_gas_giant_hot_desc:0 "A large gaseous planet with an atmosphere primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. The planet is in close proximity to the parent star and so has a very high surface temperature and a short orbital period. The atmosphere is extreme and exotic due to the short period and long days, with intense winds and super-rotating equatorial jet streams."
 pc_ice_giant:0 "Ice Giant"
 pc_ice_giant_desc:0 "A large, cold and gaseous planet composed mainly of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, such as oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur."
 pc_dwarf_planet_asteroid:0 "Barren"
 pc_dwarf_planet_asteroid_desc:0 "An object in an asteroid belt large enough to be rounded by its own gravity, this dwarf planet is barren and rocky with a thin or non-existent atmosphere. The surface is covered in meteor impact craters and completely devoid of life."
 tech_advanced_robot_colonization:0 "Advanced Robotic Colonization"
 tech_advanced_robot_colonization_desc:1 "Specialized shelters and advanced adaptive life systems allow robots to colonize planets inhospitable to alien life.\n\n"
 pc_carbon:0 "Carbon World"
 pc_carbon_desc:0 "A layer of carbon in the form of graphite forms the surface of this rocky planet. During volcanic eruptions, diamonds from the interior come up to the surface, resulting in mountains of diamonds and silicon carbides. The surface contains frozen or liquid hydrocarbons (e.g. tar and methane). However, the planet is devoid of water, and the cool atmosphere consists primarily of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide with lots of carbon smog."

 pc_white_dwarf_star:0 "White Dwarf Star"
 pc_white_dwarf_star_desc:0 "A white dwarf, also called a degenerate dwarf, is a stellar remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A white dwarf is very dense: its mass is comparable to that of the of large G Class star, while its volume is comparable to that of a small terrestrial planet. A white dwarf's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion takes place in a white dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy."
