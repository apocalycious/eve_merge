 #Black Hole Anomaly 1
 #Writing by deezee
 #Code by ShiroKitsune
 mem_black_hole_1:0 "The Path Beyond"
 mem_black_hole_1_desc:0 "The black hole [Root.GetName] appears to have a small object orbiting just outside the event horizon. Upon closer examination, it appears to be a small, ancient wormhole generator built by an unknown civilization, possibly as a way of opening a path into the event horizon and investigating what lies beyond. Our scientists would like to examine the technology closer."
 MEM_BLACK_HOLE_1_PROJECT:0 "The Path Beyond"
 MEM_BLACK_HOLE_1_PROJECT_DESC:0 "A scientist should try to activate the ancient wormhole generator..."
 mem_anomaly_event.1.name:0 "Successful Investigation"
 mem_anomaly_event.1.desc:0 "Upon closer examination, the wormhole generator has clearly been damaged by the passage of time. However, lead scientist [Root.GetLeaderName] believes that it can be repaired."

 mem_anomaly_event.3.name:0 "What Lies Beyond"
 mem_anomaly_event.3.desc:0 "The science ship has returned, and its crew has been transformed. They refuse to discuss the "unspeakable" things that lie beyond the event horizon, but we must trust that those insights will benefit our empire."
 mem_anomaly_event.3.a:0 "We hope they are all right."
 mem_anomaly_event.4.name:0 "An Old Relic"
 mem_anomaly_event.4.desc:0 "Upon closer examination, the wormhole generator has clearly been damaged by the passage of time. Given its proximity to the event horizon, further investigation would be deeply unsafe and unlikely to bear fruit."
 mem_anomaly_event.4.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 mem_anomaly_event.5.name:0 "A Tragic Mistake!"
 mem_anomaly_event.5.desc:0 "While investigating the wormhole generator, lead scientist [Root.GetLeaderName] accidentally switched it on, unaware that it was damaged. As a result, the science ship [Root.GetName] was sucked through the wormhole into the black hole, never to be seen again."

 #Code by Mourn
 #Writing by Malthus and Mourn
 mem_demon_ship_category:0 "Strange Readings"
 mem_demon_ship_category_desc:0 "First survey scans show anormal readings from the outer atmosphere of [Root.GetName]. The science team is eager to do a second and more accurate scan of the source of these readings."
 MEM_DEMON_SHIP_PROJECT:0 "Stablize Prototype Orbit"
 MEM_DEMON_SHIP_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Our scientists are confident that by docking a science ship to our prototype we will be able to correct and stabilize its orbit. This involves lengthy calculations and accurate maneuvering. They spare you the details... but underline the fact that the time window for a successful operation is limited."
 mem_anomaly_failure.3.desc:0 "Our science team was not able to identify what caused the strange readings. We may never know if there was anything at all or if it was just a sensor malfunction."
 mem_demon_ship_event.1.name:0 "Lost Prototype Ship Discovered"
 mem_demon_ship_event.1.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeaderName] is ecstatic. After more thorough scans the anomaly turns out to be a spaceship, and even more intriguing is the fact that it is one of ours. [Root.GetLeaderName] recognizes it as one of our prototype FTL-capable ships thought to be lost on a testflight years ago. Its orbit is unstable and the ship is slowly descending into the atmosphere. It seems to be undamaged but energy readings are minimal. We received no response to our hailing. In order to be able to further investigate what has happened to the ship and its crew its orbit has to be stabilized first. [Root.GetLeaderName] already came up with a plan."
 mem_demon_ship_event.1.a:0 "Save this piece of our history."
 mem_demon_ship_event.1.b:0 "Who cares about some old ship?"
 mem_demon_ship_event.2.name:0 "Orbit Stabilized"

 mem_demon_ship_event.2.a:0 "Keep me informed."
 mem_demon_ship_event.3.name:0 "Prototype Lost"
 mem_demon_ship_event.3.desc:0 "We were not able to stabilize the orbit of the FTL-Prototype before it sank into the atmosphere of the gas giant and it has been destroyed."
 mem_demon_ship_event.4.name:0 "Urgent Message"
 mem_demon_ship_event.4.desc:0 "An urgent message from Scientist [Root.GetLeaderName]. The crew is dead. Their mutiliated corpses float through the depressurized sections of the ship. As there is no decay in vaccum [Root.GetLeaderName] can only guess for how long they have been dead. It remains a mystery for now why there is no atmosphere as the ship´s hull appears intact. The ship seems to have run out of energy a while ago. It will take some time before we will know more."
 mem_demon_ship_event.4.a:0 "How horrible"
 mem_demon_ship_event.5.name:0 "Grim Discoveries"
 mem_demon_ship_event.5.desc:0 "All energy cells were exhausted and some of them had to be replaced with reserve cells from the [Root.GetName] to get at least some of the ships systems online. The logbook shows the crew joking in joyful anticipation of their first ftl-flight, but then all recordings broke up shortly after the ship´s ftl engines were activated. It is hard to assess how much time had passed before the recordings start again. The flight seems to be over and the atmo6sphere has changed completely. Those same faces smiling a moment ago are now distorted by pain and screams echo as they mutiliate themselves. The recording ends apruptly. Shall we investigate further or leave the dead to rest?"
 mem_demon_ship_event.5.a:0 "Destroy the ship. No one must know what was found."
 mem_demon_ship_event.5.b:0 "We must know what caused this tragedy."
 mem_demon_ship_event.6.name:0 "FTL-Prototype Destroyed"
 mem_demon_ship_event.6.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName} undocks from the FTL-prototype and pushes it into a descending orbit again. Shortly afterward it is consumed by the fires of atmospheric entry."
 mem_demon_ship_event.6.a:0 "May they find peace."
 mem_demon_ship_event.7.name:0 "Final Report"
 mem_demon_ship_event.7.desc:0 "Working through the sensor data recorded during the ftl event [Root.GetLeaderName] comes to the conclusion that the prototype and its crew left our plane of existence and entered another dimension where our natural laws do not apply. The severe mental stress must have driven the crew into madness. While overseeing more data a feeling of a dark presence overcomes [Root.GetLeaderName] and their assistants. They quickly remove the datacore to take it with them to the [Root.GetName]. Right after returning to their ship our science team monitors an energy spike inside the prototypes ftl core. Beeing totally perplex where it got the energy from they barely manage to undock from it before it vanishes into the void. [Root.GetLeaderName] speculates on the possibility that the ship itself might have been changed by strange dimensional energies. Might it be alive? We may never know, but the retrieved datacore provides significant data on ftl travel."
 mem_demon_ship_event.7.a:0 "Our knowledge expands!"
 mem_demon_ship_event.8.name:0 "Final Report"
 mem_demon_ship_event.8.desc:0 "Working through the sensor data recorded during the ftl event [Root.GetLeaderName] comes to the conclusion that the prototype and its crew left our plane of existence and entered another dimension where our natural laws do not apply. The severe mental stress must have driven the crew into madness. While overseeing some more data he is interrupted by noise of the crew fighting and screaming. One of [Root.GetLeaderName]'s assistants had gone mad trying to destroy the [Root.GetName] while shouting out shredded sentences about how the prototype was alive and demanding more passengers to the "Other Side". With luck and some injuries the rest of the team manages to confine them aboard the scienceship. After this event [Root.GetLeaderName] chose to destroy the prototype and everything it might have aboard with it from this "Other Side" using the ship's self destruct device. We might never know what exactly happened to the ship and it´s crew but our science team is alive and chief scientist [Root.GetLeaderName}´s colleague is on the way to recovery."
 mem_demon_ship_event.8.a:0 "Tragedy averted"
 mem_demon_ship_event.9.name:0 "Final Transmission"
 mem_demon_ship_event.9.desc:0 "Working through the sensor data recorded during the ftl event [Root.GetLeaderName] came to the conclusion that the prototype and its crew left our plane of existence and entered another dimension where our natural laws do not apply. The severe mental stress must have driven the crew into madness. The transmission of science data changes into a video transmission at the end. The chief scientist stands in front of the camera holding their own eyes in their hands while speaking in a low voice: "We go now to the Other Side". Agonizing screams from the science team echo through the transmission before it ends. Recovery teams searching for our scienceship found no traces..."
 mem_demon_ship_event.9.a:0 "Horrifying"
